Designed and implemented a plant health analysis system using deep learning, with a frontend built in HTML and CSS and a backend developed with Flask. 
The system provides real-time disease diagnoses and treatment suggestions based on uploaded plant leaf images. Through this project, I gained skills in time management, team building, coordination, and representation.
